Among the remarkable growth of the industry, the “native vs. cross-platform” app development debate is also powerful. In 2017, Android and iOS, the two commonly used operating systems for smartphones, held a market share of 85.1% and 14.8% respectively. As of March 2018, there were 3.8 million apps in Google Play (for Android) and 2 million in Apple’s App Store (for iOS).
Even so, given that both platforms are critical for a productive mobile app strategy, cross platform mobile app development might seem to be the best answer for this debate. Today it is no longer tenable to simply build an app that targets only one platform – we need multi-platform apps that can support both Android and iPhone smartphones and ensure no one is left out.

cross platform vs native mobile app development

	Cross-Platform Mobile Apps:
There are different operating systems running on various smartphones with <a href="https://www.innvonix.com/android-application-development">Android</a> and <a href="https://www.innvonix.com/iphone-application-development">iOS</a> featuring as the most widely used. Each of these platforms utilizes a unique programming with its own language and API.
As such, the need by mobile developers to reach the largest possible user-base, regardless of their preferred platform has given rise to more value being seen in a cross platform mobile app. Tools like Xamarin have made cross-platform app development widely popular and accessible. 

What is Cross-Platform Application?

Cross-Platform Application simply refers to the advancement of <a href="https://www.innvonix.com/mobile-app-development">mobile application development</a> that can be utilized across a variety of different operating systems. It is the process of developing apps compatible with multiple mobile platforms using a solitary codebase, rather than having to create the app on multiple occasions using the respective native technologies for each platform.

<b>Advantages of Developing a Cross-Platform Mobile App:</b>

It’s cost-effective:

The issue of native app vs cross platform apps can be debated but when it comes to cost efficiency, <a href="https://www.innvonix.com/cross-platform-mobile-app-development">cross-platform mobile app development</a> beats the latter hands down. In addition to most cross-platform development tools being unreservedly available, the approach further spares the cost of having to contract separate developers to create apps for different platforms.

It’s reusable:

With cross-platform apps, developers no longer have to write unique code for each operating system. They can instead use a common codebase to transfer the code to different platforms. 

It allows you to reach a wider audience:

Creating a multi-platform app frees developers from the need to choose among platforms - they can target both Android and iOS users without losing the potential audience. 

Consistent app performance across platforms:

If a developer writes a native app for each operating system, the two might require significant changes when it comes to UI and features supported due to the differences in how the two platforms implement functions. With cross-platform apps, drastic changes between the applications on various systems are not much of an issue as the two shares a common codebase. This way there will be fewer visible performance and UI changes, so your brand identity will remain coherent. 

<b>Disadvantages of Developing a Cross-Platform Mobile App:</b>

Complex development process:

It takes a skilled developer to create an application that would be well-adapted to a few platforms. Basically, there’s a need to keep all the little differences between operating systems and the hardware they run on especially when it comes to implementing a complex interface and features. 

Challenging integration: 

Developers can experience difficulties while integrating cross-platform applications to local setting and engaging a third-party cloud service provider. The code of an HTML5 cross-platform app is complicated as the result of callback-style programming used to communicate with native plugins.

User experience might be somewhat limited: 

A cross-platform app might not be able to offer a wide array of user journeys. This is mainly caused by the fact that there are features that are supported only by a particular operating system. 
Times when you should choose developing a cross-platform app:

•	When it’s not clear right away which platform is more lucrative to go with

•	Your app doesn’t have any sophisticated features that would be to challenging to maintain over different platforms 

•	Budget constraints don’t allow you to hire separate teams to create both Android and iOS applications

Cross-Platform App Examples:

•	Facebook
•	Skype
•	Slack
•	Alibaba

Native Mobile Apps:

A native app is usually written in one programming language for a particular operating system. Compared to other types of products, native apps offer a consistent performance and are times more reliable. Depending on the platform an app is developed for, specific programming languages are used. For iOS, it’s mainly Objective-C and Swift, while Android developers write in Java or Kotlin.
